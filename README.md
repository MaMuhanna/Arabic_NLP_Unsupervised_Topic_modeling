# Arabic_NLP_Unsupervised_Topic_modeling

## Introduction
Our Problem is about Arabic NLP and our task will be To prepare a dataset & classify each document into a category.
Our Goal we will develop an Arabic topic modeling to predict the correct topic of newspaper articles that can correctly classify the topic.

## Data 
The dataset we will use contains Arabic newspaper articles.
- ID | contains the ID of article
- Subject | contains brief description about the article.
- Content | contains the text in the article.

Our goal to Categories the articles into 4 categories : 
- Health
- Sports
- Politics
- Economy

## Models

- LSA | Has not work well with our data
- NMF | Has not work well with our data
- Clustring | Has gave us best results

## Conclusion 
At the beginning we clean our data and after that We tried three different approaches to topic modeling but the only  model with good results was K-means so we will choose this model. From this project we were hoping to have good results with Arabic data since there are only a few resources for Arabic NLP.
